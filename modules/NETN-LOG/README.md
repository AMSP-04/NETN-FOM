The NATO Education and Training Network Logistics Module (NETN-LOG) provides a standard interface for representing supplies, equipment and personnel when modelled as part of an aggregated entity. The module also includes support for logistics tasks in a federated distributed simulation.

Military logistics is the discipline of planning and carrying out the movement and maintenance of military forces, including storage, distribution, maintenance and transportation of supplies, equipment and personnel.

The NETN Logistics module covers the following tasks:    
* Resupply, e.g. refuelling aircraft at an airbase or in the air
* Repair, e.g. repair of damaged platforms in a facility
* Transport, e.g. transporting supplies from a specific pick-up point to an off-loading destination
