The NATO Education and Training Network (NETN) Base Datatypes (BASE) Module provides standard definitions of datatypes and extends the RPR-BASE FOM Module.

This module is a base module for all other NETN FOM modules. It specifies standard data types and structures and extends the RPR-BASE module. The specification is based on IEEE 1516 High Level Architecture (HLA) Object Model Template (OMT) and supports interoperability in a federated simulation (federation) based on HLA. An HLA-based Federation Object Model (FOM) is used to specify types of data and their encoding on the network.



## Overview 
 
### Unique Identification 
 
In HLA, the RTI uses a handle of the data type `ObjectInstanceHandle` to identify instances in `RTIambassador` and `FederateAmbassador` services. Every object instance in a federation execution receives a unique handle when it is registered. The object instance has a unique name, either specified by the registering federate or generated by the RTI. The instance handle does not persist between different federation executions or if an object is removed and re-registered. The instance name is unique in a federation execution, but if generated by the RTI, it is not guaranteed to remain the same between federation executions. The federate can also provide an object instance name by first reserving the name and then using it when registering the object instance. Re-registering using the same name is not allowed. Therefore, object instances with auto-generated handles and names get new values if their owning federate leaves and later re-joins a federation execution. 
 
The RPR-FOM uses the `BaseEntity` attribute `EntityIdentifier` for unique entity identification. In addition, some RPR-FOM interactions use the object instance name to reference an object instance. The `EntityIdentifier` is a triple consisting of `SiteID`, `ApplicationID` and `EntityNumber`, where the site and application identify the federate registering the object and is responsible for updates of the RPR-FOM entity state attributes. The entity number is generated by the federate registering the object and is unique among all objects registered by the same federate. In addition, the `PhysicalEntity` attribute `Marking` and the `AggregateEntity` attribute `AggregateMarking` are sometimes used to identify instances in a federation execution by name. However, these attributes are not intended to identify entities uniquely and are limited-length strings. 
 
The NETN-BASE FOM module defines the required `HLAobjectRoot` attribute `UniqueId` as a Universally Unique Identifier (UUID) based on ISO/IEC 11578:1996 (and ISO/IEC 9834-8:2005). This attribute extends all objects using NETN-BASE, and its value can persist between federation executions if required. The UUID consists of an array with 16 bytes and has a standardized printable format that consists of 32 ASCII characters (0-9, a-f) and four hyphens on predetermined places, e.g., 550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000. 
 
In the NETN FOM modules, references to objects use the UUID datatype and rely on federates to resolve references to objects with the referenced `UniqueId`. 
 
Similarly, the NETN-BASE defines the optional `HLAinteractionRoot` parameter `UniqueId`. The primary purpose of this parameter is to allow other subsequent interactions, e.g., acknowledgments, to reference a previously sent interaction. 
 
### Scenario Time 
 
Logical time (or Simulation Time) coordinates and synchronizes data exchange in a distributed simulation. HLA time management services can control the advancement of logical time. To pace logical time, use wall-clock time to manage a real-time or scaled real-time simulation. The RPR-FOM handles synchronization by timestamping each update and relying on synchronized system clocks to advance time. Logical time representation and the methods for synchronizing the advancing of time in a distributed simulation can vary between different federations. 
 
Scenario time is displayed to simulation operators working with the actual scenario. Scenario time can be linked to the pace of logical time advancement but is an independent representation. E.g., during simulation, the logical time is strictly increasing (much like wall-clock time) and can never move backward. However, scenario time may move forward or backward. 
 
The NETN-BASE FOM module defines the optional `HLAobjectRoot` attribute `ScenarioTime` for timestamping objects with the creation time specified as scenario time. Similarly, the NETN-BASE defines the optional `HLAinteractionRoot` parameter `ScenarioTime`, which represents the send-time of the interaction specified as scenario time.
