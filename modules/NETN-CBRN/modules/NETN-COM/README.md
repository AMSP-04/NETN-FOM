# NETN-COM
NATO Education and Training Network (NETN) Communication (COM) Module. 
        
This module is a specification of how to represent Communication Networks and related connectivity data to be shared among participants in a federated distributed simulation. The specification is based on IEEE 1516 High Level Architecture (HLA) Object Model Template (OMT) and primarily intended to support interoperability in a federated simulation (federation) based on HLA. An HLA OMT based Federation Object Model (FOM) is used to specify types of data and how it is encoded on the network. The NETN COM FOM module is available as an XML file for use in HLA based federations.
        
## Purpose
The purpose of the NETN COM module is to provide a standard way to exchange data related to Communication Networks and Physical Networks. The main objective is to provide a generic model that represents the status of connections in a communication network and links in a physical network.   
The Communication Networks can be set up to use radios, ethernet, satellite communication or laser based links, transmitting from point to point or routing through the network.

## Versions, updates and extensions

All updates and versioning of this work is coordinated by the NATO Modelling and Simulation Coordination Office (MSCO), managed by the NATO Modelling and Simulation Group (NMSG) and performed as NATO Science and Technology Organization (STO) technical activities in support of the NMSG Modelling and Simulation Standards Subgroup (MS3).

Feedback on the use of this work, suggestions for improvements and identified issues are welcome and can be provided using GitHub issue tracking. To engage in the development and update of this FOM Module please contact your national NMSG representative.

Version numbering of this FOM Module and associated documentation is based on the following principles:

* New official version number is assigned and in effect only when a new release is made in the Master branch.
* Updates in the Develop branch will not change the version number.
* In the FOM Module `useHistory` information includes only information on official releases.
* Update of the major version number is made if the change constitutes a major restructuring, merging, addition or redefinition of semantics that breaks backward compatibility or cover entirely new concepts.
* Update of the minor version number is made if the change constitutes minor additions to existing concepts and editorial changes that do not break backward compatibility but may require updates of software to use new concepts.
* Patches are released to fix minor issues that do not break backward compatibility.
