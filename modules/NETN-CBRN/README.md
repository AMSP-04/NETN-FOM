The NATO Education and Training Network Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear (NETN-CBRN) provides a standard interface for representing CBRN release, detection, effects, and protective measures in a federated distributed simulation. E.g., the exposure effect on individual humans in a CBRN-contaminated Hazard area where the human is represented in one simulation and the effect is modelled in another federate simulation.

CBRN are Chemical, Biological, Radiological and Nuclear materials that can be delivered intentionally as a weapon using conventional bombs, explosive materials and enhanced blast weapons (e.g., dirty bombs) or unintentionally caused by human error or natural or technological reasons, such as spills, accidental releases or leakages. 

The NETN-CBRN module specifies how to model CBRN-related events in a federated distributed simulation.

## Versions, updates and extensions

All updates and versioning of this work are coordinated by the NATO Modelling and Simulation Coordination Office (MSCO), managed by the NATO Modelling and Simulation Group (NMSG) and performed as NATO Science and Technology Organization (STO) technical activities in support of the NMSG Modelling and Simulation Standards Subgroup (MS3).

Feedback on the use of this work, suggestions for improvements and identified issues are welcome and can be provided using GitHub issue tracking. To engage in the development and update of this FOM Module please contact your national NMSG representative.

Version numbering of this FOM Module and associated documentation is based on the following principles:

* A new official version number is in effect only when a new release is made in the Master branch.
* An update of the major version number is made if the change constitutes a major restructuring, merging, addition or redefinition of semantics that breaks backward compatibility or covers entirely new concepts.
* An update of the minor version number is made if the change constitutes minor additions to existing concepts and editorial changes that do not break backward compatibility but may require updates of software to use new concepts.
* Patches are released to fix minor issues that do not break backward compatibility.
