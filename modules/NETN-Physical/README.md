# NETN-Physical

## Introduction

The NETN FAFD representation of physical entities such as platforms is based on the [SISO-STD-001-2015 standard RPR-FOM v2.0](https://www.sisostds.org/). The NETN FOM Module extends the RPR-FOM object classes representing physical entities with sub-classes which include additional attributes for e.g unique identification of simulated entities.

It is recommended that NETN federates support NETN extensions of Physical Entities. For compatibility reasons, NETN federates, that implement NETN extensions of RPR-FOM Physical Entities, are also required to support RPR-FOM v2.0.

## Versions, updates and extensions

All updates and versioning of this work is coordinated by the NATO Modelling and Simulation Coordination Office (MSCO), managed by the NATO Modelling and Simulation Group (NMSG) and performed as NATO Science and Technology Organization (STO) technical activities in support of the NMSG Modelling and Simulation Standards Subgroup (MS3).

Feedback on the use of this work, suggestions for improvements and identified issues are welcome and can be provided using GitHub issue tracking. To engage in the development and update of this FOM Module please contact your national NMSG representative.

Version numbering of this FOM Module and associated documentation is based on the following principles:

* New official version number is assigned and in effect only when a new release is made in the Master branch.
* Updates in the Develop branch will not change the version number.
* In the FOM Module `useHistory` information includes only information on official releases.
* Update of the major version number is made if the change constitutes a major restructuring, merging, addition or redefinition of semantics that breaks backward compatibility or cover entirely new concepts.
* Update of the minor version number is made if the change constitutes minor additions to existing concepts and editorial changes that do not break backward compatibility but may require updates of software to use new concepts.
* Patches are released to fix minor issues that do not break backward compatibility.
