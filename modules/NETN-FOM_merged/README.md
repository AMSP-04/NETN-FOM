This folder contain the entire NETN-FOM merged and exported in HLA Evolved format.
It comes in two almost identical versions, one is merged with only the RPR-modules that each NETN-Module require at a minimum (NETN-Merged.xml). 
While the other is merged with the entire RPR_FOM_v2.0_1516-2010 (NETN-Merged-FULL.xml)
For both of these modules to fully work you must also load the NETN-MIM. 
This custom mim is the standrad mim with the extension to HLAobjectRoot and HLAinteractionRoot made in NETN-BASE and NETN-TMR.
