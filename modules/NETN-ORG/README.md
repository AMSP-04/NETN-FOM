The NATO Education and Training Organization (NETN-ORG) module provides a standard way to represent organizations in the simulation scenario and their relationships and structure. The relationships include unit command structure, relationships between organizations, unit equipment, and installations.

Simulating organizational elements requires knowledge of intra-organizational relationships, e.g., superior, subordinate, and inter-organizational relationships with other organizations, e.g., friendly or hostile. The NETN-ORG supports initialization and organizations' dynamic change of this information.

Use the NETN-ORG information to: 
* initialize simulated entities 
* perform disaggregation, aggregation, divide and merge actions using NETN-MRM 
* change organizational relationships 
* capture simulated unit and equipment state as snapshots

* An update of the major version number is made if the change constitutes a major restructuring, merging, addition or redefinition of semantics that breaks backward compatibility or covers entirely new concepts.
* An update of the minor version number is made if the change constitutes minor additions to existing concepts and editorial changes that do not break backward compatibility but may require updates of software to use new concepts.
* Patches are released to fix minor issues that do not break backward compatibility.
