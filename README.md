# NETN FOM
NATO Education and Training Network (NETN) Federation Object Model (FOM)

â€ƒ
## Executive Summary


Efficient and effective use of NATO and national Modelling & Simulation (M&S) capabilities, to support training, requires standards for connecting and integrating M&S components across the training system enterprise.

The NATO Education and Training Network Federation Object Model (NETN-FOM) document provides a common information exchange data model for developing interoperable distributed simulation systems.

The NETN-FOM focuses on technical interoperability issues in distributed simulation and provides patterns for scenario initialization, transfer of modelling responsibilities, simulation entity tasking and patterns for managing dynamic change of model resolution.

The AMSP-04 document provides a summary of all NETN-FOM modules, key design patterns and main concepts. Full on-line documentation and all related data models and files are provided through http://www.github.org/AMSP-04

## Versions, updates and extensions

All updates and versioning of this work is coordinated by the NATO Modelling and Simulation Coordination Office (MSCO), managed by the NATO Modelling and Simulation Group (NMSG) and performed as NATO Science and Technology Organization (STO) technical activities in support of the NMSG Modelling and Simulation Standards Subgroup (MS3).

Feedback on the use of this work, suggestions for improvements and identified issues are welcome and can be provided using GitHub issue tracking. To engage in the development and update of NETN FOM, please contact your national NMSG representative.

Version numbering of the NETN FOM and associated documentation is based on the following principles:

* New official version number is assigned and in effect only when a new release is made in the Master branch.
* Updates in the Develop branch will not change the version number.
* Update of the major version number is made if the change constitutes a major restructuring, merging, addition or redefinition of semantics that breaks backward compatibility or cover entirely new concepts.
* Update of the minor version number is made if the change constitutes minor additions to existing concepts and editorial changes that do not break backward compatibility but may require updates of software to use new concepts.
* Patches are released to fix minor issues that do not break backward compatibility.

|Version|Description|

|v1.0|Initial release of NETN FOM as developed by MSG-068 |
|v2.0|Release of NETN FOM included in AMSP-04 Ed A|
|v3.0|Release of NETN FOM included in AMSP-04 Ed B|
|v4.0|Release of NETN FOM included in AMSP-04 Ed C|

[Changelog](changelog.md)

## Repository structure
* [Modules](modules/) contain each module in its sub folder, these sub-folder contain the fom file, documentation and any related files.
* [FomFiles_Merged_HLA_Evolved](FomFiles_Merged_HLA_Evolved/) contain a merged version of the entire NETN 4 and RPR modules in HLA Evolved format.
* [FomFiles_HLA4](FomFiles_HLA4/) contains only the Fom files in HLA 4 format, no documentation, sub-folders or extra files.


## Maintenance on GitHub
* The master branch of the NETN FOM repository contains the official public releases of the FOM.
* The develop branch of the NETN FOM repository contains the intermediate baseline releases of the FOM and the lasest build/merge of other feature branches/forks used by members of the maintenance team to update the FOM.
