# ETR FOM module

Entity Tasking and Reporting (ETR) provides a simulator independent way of command and control
over simulated entities, from both simulation operation perspective as well as entity modelling perspective. ETR contains common low level tasks that can easily be interpreted and executed by simulators that model the behavior of entities. It also defines a set of reports to provide status information, including the
status of the tasks being executed by simulated entities.
