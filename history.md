# History

In 2006, NATO Allied Command Transformation (ACT) requested NATO Modelling
and Simulation Group (NMSG) to explore the concepts of a NATO Education and Training Network capability. An exploratory team (ET-025) was set up to analyze the requirement and it proposed a technical activity to develop the NETN concepts. 

In 2007, the NMSG technical activity **MSG-068 NETN** was started. The group was led by NATO Joint Warfare Center (JWC) and with participants from NATO HQ-SACT, NATO Joint Forces Training Center (JFTC), NATO Consultancy, Command and Control Agency (NC3A) and 13 Nations (Australia, Bulgaria, France, Germany, Hungary, Netherlands, Romania, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UK, USA). MSG-068 assessed the distributed simulation and learning capabilities that could contribute to the development of an NETN capability and drafted standards to better enable reuse and sharing of national Modelling and Simulation systems. A NETN Federation Architecture and FOM Design specification (NETN FAFD) was produced which included the NETN-FOM v1.0. The capabilities were demonstrated at I/ITSEC 2010 and the group ended its work in 2011.

In early 2012, the NMSG technical activity **MSG-106 SPHINX** was started as a follow-on to MSG-106 but with a slightly larger scope. The technical subgroup of MSG-106 continued to work on the NETN FAFD specification and delivered a draft NETN-FOM v2.0 which included several new FOM modules and other improvements. The updated FOM was also included in the draft Allied Modelling and Simulation Publication (AMSP-04) NATO Education and Training Network Federation Architecture and FOM Design (NETN FAFD).

In late 2014, the NMSG technical activity **MSG-134 NATO Distributed Simulation Architecture & Design, Compliance Testing and Certification** was started as a follow-on for continued maintenance of the NETN FAFD and to continue work on establishing the NATO HLA certification process identified in STANAG 4603. The group did not add any new modules to the NETN-FOM but it assisted NMSG in updating the draft AMSP-04 to a final version inclduing an official NETN-FOM v2.0 release. The group ended its work in late 2017 and the AMSP-04 was later promulgted and published by NATO in March 2018 and is covered by NATO STANREC 4800.

In early 2018, the NMSG technical activity **MSG-163 Evolving NATO Standards for Federated Simulation** started as a follow-on to MSG-134. The group provided a draft updated AMSP-04 Ed B v1.0 NETN FAFD document including NETN-FOM v3.0 that incudes both new modules and several updates based on NATO and national experiences using the NETN-FOM.
